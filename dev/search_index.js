Moreover, even when disregarding the Monte Carlo simulations themselves, loading the necessary data requires at least 85 GB of storage space, not to mention the required RAM needed to manipulate the data. This exceeded the technical limits of one of our computers. Therefore, we initially tried to load only most relevant parts of the package and data onto Nuvolos, hoping that this could resolve storage issues. However, the files were still too large for us to access fully, as our cloud space is limited to 50 GB and is insufficient to decompress the .zip-files we needed.

This meant that we attempted to manually repeat some steps of the data cleaning process using the raw data in bash, which diverted us from the actual replication process. The main problem here was that it was not at all obvious which files were used for which figure, as the code itself relied on running the environment and associated functions which we could not load.

To answer this question, the authors use sub-national data from 40 countries to estimate age-specific mortality-temperature-relationships which they then extrapolate to the rest of the world to assess global mortality risks linked to climate change. The authors then combine this with different climate change projections to estimate fatality rates in the upcoming decades. Finally, based on their regional estimates of mortality rates given climate and income data, they use a revealed preferences approach to infer the costs of climate change adaptation. They find that mortality rates will increase especially in very cold and very hot regions in the more than 64 age group, disproportionately affect poor countries, and estimate the climate-change mortality risk at 3.2% of global GDP under their projected climate change adaptation scenario.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"For our replication, we wanted to reproduce figures on the temperature-mortality relationship by age group and its distribution across geographical regions.
